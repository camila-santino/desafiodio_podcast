Futuristic, cyber minimal digital scene showing a glowing cursor rendering the text “Pixel por Pixel” letter by letter in real time, on a dark background of deep black or petroleum blue with smooth subtle texture. Surrounded by delicate UI-inspired elements — progress bars, code lines, forming pixels, and abstract digital circuits — evoking dynamic knowledge generation. Centered composition, straight-on view, captured with a Canon EOS R5 and 50mm f/1.2 lens, soft diffused rim lighting in blue and cyan tones, balanced contrast between darkness and neon glow. Symmetrical layout, negative space emphasis, subtle neon bloom, slight depth of field, volumetric haze, and gentle particle light effects to enhance the technological, precise, and futuristic atmosphere.
